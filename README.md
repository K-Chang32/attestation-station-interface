# Attestation Station Interface

An open source interface for Optimism's Attestation Station -- a data primative for making arbitrary attestations about Ethereum addresses.

This is currently functional, but with no guardrails or useful user feedback.

<!-- TODO: Add link to Optimism's resources when they're live-->
