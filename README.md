# Attestation Station Interface

An open source interface for Optimism's Attestation Station -- a data primative for making arbitrary attestations about Ethereum addresses.

This is currently functional, but with minimal guardrails and in need of improved UI/UX.

## Run Locally

```
yarn
yarn start
```

<!-- TODO: Add link to Optimism's resources when they're live-->
